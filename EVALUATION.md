What went well:

Throughout this process, the creation of HTML structures and fluid grid system through CSS was very smooth with little difficulties. I managed to create a fully working responsive twelve column grid system using offset-1 through 12 and col-1 through 12. This made it easy to adjust to mobile screen sizes through making all column widths 100% ensuring all items stacked. I also used a simple class of 'desktop-only' on elements that I only wanted available on desktop devices. This was simply removed through a media query and the css rule display: none.

What I found hard:

It took me a while to understand VueJS components, and took several days before I got the contact-form.vue component working however with determination and guidance from my tutor the result works as intended including form validation and realtime input updates greeting the user with their input name.
