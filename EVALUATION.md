# Evaluation

What went well:

Throughout this process, the creation of HTML structures and fluid grid system through CSS was very smooth with little difficulties. I managed to create a fully working responsive twelve column grid system using offset-1 through 12 and col-1 through 12. This made it easy to adjust to mobile screen sizes through making all column widths 100% ensuring all items stacked. I also used a simple class of 'desktop-only' on elements that I only wanted available on desktop devices. This was simply removed through a media query and the css rule display: none.

What went not so well:

It took me a while to understand VueJS components, and took several days before I got the contact-form.vue component working however with determination and guidance from my tutor the result works as intended including form validation and realtime input updates greeting the user with their input name (as shown below).

What I would improve:

In future, I would add styling with the form validation through JavaScript, turning borders red when inputs were invalid. This was not acheived due to lack of time. Therefore, time management should have been better with a clear schedule being laid out and utilising the full time given for the assignment.
